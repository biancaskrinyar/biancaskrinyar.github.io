   		<h1> WRITER. EDITOR. ASPIRING ENTREPRENEUR. EVENT ORGANISER.</h1>
  		
	<div class="paragraph">
		
		<p>I have been engaging in wide-ranging fields, including customer success and account management, and various forms of writing, editing and event organisation. I continuously seek ways to challenge and deepen my interdisciplinary knowledge. This is particularly important to me, as I wish to use my knowledge to raise awareness of social issues, and to establish connections between the arts, social activism and education.</p>
		
		<h2>WRITER.</h2>
	
		<p>I write flash fiction, short stories, as well as long-form prose, exploring queerness, family, psychogeography, and speculative futures. My writing has been published in Tint Journal, The Bubble, and The Northern Review. I am currently working on my first novel, set in a dystopian city, following the lives of four queer protagonists.</p>
		
		<p>I have also worked on theatre sets as a co-writer, dramaturg and producer at Durham University productions and at Spinoza, a Hungarian theatre. I worked for Mumus Production as a translator and co-editor of an animated feature film, forthcoming in 2026.</p>
		
	
		<h2>EDITOR.</h2>

		<p>In 2020, I joined the New Sociological Perspectives, a peer-reviewed graduate Sociology Journal as an Editor. Between 2022-2024, I was the Editor in Chief of the Journal. During this time, I helped edit, copy-edit, and proof four issues, which included multiple research articles, book reviews, translations, and interviews.</p>

		<p>I am currently working as a freelance Editor at the Ancillary Review of Books (ARB), a finalist for the 2025 Hugo Awards in the category of Best Fanzine.</p>
	
		<h2>ASPIRING ENTREPRENEUR.</h2>

		<p>I am currently working on launching my own social enterprise which combines my extensive experience and my passion for helping people. I am working on creating an inclusive platform and community for and by queer people across the world to share and reflect on their lived experiences and structural pressures of being queer.</p>	
	
		<h2>EVENT ORGANISER.</h2>
	
		<p>In the past, I organised various small-scale events, such as film screenings, poetry readings, meetings with film directors, panel discussions with academics and creatives, client dinners, happy hours, and webinars. With regards to large-scale events, I organised a week-long trip to the Berlin Film Festival, a four-day long summer camp for about 100 students, a day-long festival for students and locals in Groningen, and the 2021 London Startup Fair, which attracted 1,000 unique participants and 45 companies during the 4 days.</p>
